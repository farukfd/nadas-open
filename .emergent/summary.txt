The trajectory describes the development of a real estate index mobile application, initially requested as a website-to-mobile conversion. The AI engineer started by analyzing an SQL database, deducing core features like real estate listings, geographic data, and a content management system. This evolved into a sophisticated Emlak Endeksi app, competitive with Endeksa.com, incorporating user management (guest, individual, corporate with free queries and package sales), m2 price time series, and demographic analysis.

Key development phases included setting up the FastAPI backend and Expo React Native frontend, implementing user authentication (login/register), a query system, and a custom map with interactive features like heatmap, favorites, and comparison tools. A significant turn was the user's request to match 's corporate identity, leading to extensive UI/UX adjustments, including integrating specific background images and styling. Several bugs, including cache issues, CSS errors, and network timeouts, were identified and resolved, with the help of a  for complex problems. The project is currently focused on achieving a Production Ready System, addressing critical authentication, data integration, and missing page functionalities.

<current_work>
The project is currently in the Production Ready System development phase. Previously, the AI successfully built out the core -branded homepage, including a Google-like search bar, property type selection, and integrated specific visual elements like background image and styling. A smart map system with heatmap, favorites, and comparison features was implemented.

Recently, several bugs were addressed: a UI cache issue, a duplicate  error in , and a critical Yükleniyor... (Loading) screen issue on the homepage caused by a network timeout in the authentication status check. The AI also enhanced the homepage with 81 il, 963 ilçe veri noktası statistics and enriched the detail page () with demographic data and favorite options.

The last identified issues are persistent login problems, the absence of a functional admin page (only UI was created), and the general lack of real data integration from the  file. The user specifically requested a Production Ready System based on a detailed report from the AI. The AI has just completed the Login Sistemi Düzeltme step, and started creating placeholder pages for the Üye Profil Sistemi ( and ). The immediate next instruction from the user is to continue with Critical Fixes and Missing Pages.
